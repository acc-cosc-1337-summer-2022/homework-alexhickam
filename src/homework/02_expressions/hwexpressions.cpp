//b) In file hwexpressions.cpp  write function code, multiply tax_rate and meal_amount and return their

//d) In file hwexpressions.cpp, write function code to multiply  meal_amount and tip_rate, return their 
   // product.
//example

#include "hwexpressions.h"

//ask for keyed_entry and multiply by meal_amount
//cout product

//multiply keyed_entry by meal amount
//cout product


//double get_sales_tax_amount(double num);
//{
//	double value = num + .0675;
 //  return value;
//}



//write function code here

//meal_amount = product1
//tax_rate * meal_amount = product2
//tip_rate * meal_amount = product3
