/*
 Modify the code in main function to replace the repeating code that uses cin to capture
    letter_grade and credit_hours from the keyboard with a do-while loop.  In the loop, keep the
    sum of credit points and credit hours. The loop continues until the user opts out. Do the gpa
    calculation after the loop.

In file src/homework/03_decisions/main.cpp:
     Create a loop that continues until the user opts to exit.
         Capture data from the keyboard for letter grade and credit points
		  After user opts out.
    Calculate the GPA and display the total credit points and total credit hours.

	5) Save your changes.
